Dear User,

I am pleased to have you try the early version of my PowerPoint Slide Creator in C#.
Just a word of warning: this project works right now, but its really stingy about keywords so keep it simple stupid.
For example beans + brew will return a plethora of pleasant coffee images, but for things like the RUSH song Fly by Night will basically return nothing
and will cause the program to crash. This program only returns images from free-images.com due to the complexity of modern websites. Sorry no Google Images for now.
No fancy schmancy 3rd party APIs were used for this project. Only official Microsoft APIs were used for this project. Thank you for downloading and please leave behind
some helpful comments.

Oh and I recommend using the .zip folder and .exe file found within for now. Easier to setup instead of installing all files and VS.

The best thing for now would be to implement some feedback for the program to see if it brought back anything at all.
ToDo:
1. More User Feedback
2. Exception/Error Handling
3. Better Image Search Engine?
