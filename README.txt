PowerPoint Slide Creator in C# takes Keywords from Title and bolded words in the Content box and searches for images from " free-images.com ".

Just a word of warning: this project works right now, but be careful about the keyword selection as it must return something.
For example beans + brew will return a plethora of pleasant coffee images. This program only returns images from free-images.com.
No 3rd party APIs were used for this project. Only official Microsoft APIs. Thank you for downloading and please leave behind
some helpful comments.

To Run, extract the "PowerSlider.zip" folder and run "PowerSlider.exe"

Future Improvements:
1. Interactive Feedback
2. Exception/Error Handling
3. Alternative Image Search Engine?
